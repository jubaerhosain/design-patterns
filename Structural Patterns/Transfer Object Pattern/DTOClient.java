/**
 * Transfer data between software application layers or tiers.
 * 
 * It is also known as the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern.
 * The main goal of this pattern is to encapsulate a group of attributes
 * into a single object in order to reduce the number of method calls and
 * improve performance by reducing the amount of data transmitted between
 * different layers of an application.
 */

/**
 * 1. Transfer Object (DTO): This is the main component of the pattern. It is a
 * simple, serializable, and often immutable object that contains a set of
 * fields or attributes. The purpose of the DTO is to carry data between
 * different layers of an application. It does not contain any business logic
 * but is rather a plain data container.
 * 
 * 2. Client: The client is responsible for creating the Transfer Object and
 * populating its attributes with data. In many cases, the client is the layer
 * of the application that interacts with the user interface or external
 * systems.
 * 
 * 3. Business Service: This layer is responsible for processing business logic. It
 * receives the Transfer Object, extracts the necessary data, and performs the
 * required operations. The business service is responsible for interacting with
 * the underlying data source or services.
 */

/**
 * The Transfer Object Pattern is often used in scenarios where there is a need
 * to reduce the number of method calls across different layers of an
 * application, especially in distributed systems where network communication
 * can be a performance bottleneck. By encapsulating data in a Transfer Object,
 * it is possible to transmit the required information in a more efficient
 * manner.
