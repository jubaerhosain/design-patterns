Whether to use direct HTTP, a message queue, or pub/sub for inter-service communication depends on a number of factors, including:

* **Reliability:** Message queues and pub/sub are more reliable than direct HTTP, as they can guarantee delivery of messages even if one of the services is unavailable.
* **Scalability:** Message queues and pub/sub can be scaled more easily than direct HTTP, as they can decouple the production and consumption of messages.
* **Asynchronicity:** Message queues and pub/sub are asynchronous, meaning that the producer of a message does not need to wait for the consumer to respond before continuing. This can improve performance and scalability.
* **Complexity:** Message queues and pub/sub can add complexity to your system, as they require additional infrastructure and code to implement.

In general, you should use direct HTTP for inter-service communication when:

* Reliability is not critical.
* Scalability is not a concern.
* Synchronicity is required.
* Complexity is a concern.

You should use a message queue or pub/sub for inter-service communication when:

* Reliability is critical.
* Scalability is a concern.
* Asynchronicity is required.
* Complexity is acceptable.

Here are some specific examples of when to use each type of inter-service communication:

**Direct HTTP:**

* A user service calling an authentication service to authenticate a user.
* A product service calling a pricing service to get the price of a product.
* A shopping cart service calling a payment service to process a payment.

**Message queue:**

* A post service sending a message to a notification service when a new post is created.
* An order service sending a message to a fulfillment service when an order is placed.
* A payment service sending a message to a fraud detection service to check for fraud.

**Pub/sub:**

* A social media service publishing messages to all of a user's followers when they post something new.
* A news service publishing messages to all of its subscribers when a new article is published.
* A real-time analytics service publishing messages to all of its subscribers with the latest data.

Ultimately, the best way to decide which type of inter-service communication to use is to consider your specific requirements. If you are unsure, it is best to err on the side of caution and use a message queue or pub/sub, as this will give you more flexibility and scalability in the future.
