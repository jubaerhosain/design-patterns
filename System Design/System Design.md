	- (Reverse) Proxies
	- Load balancer
	- API Gateway
	- Caching with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
	- Message Queues
	 
2. System design fundamentals- 2
	- Performance vs scalability
	- Latency vs throughput
	- Availability vs consistency
	- Redundancy
	- MapReduce
  
3. Cloud models
	- On premises
		- IaaS
		- PaaS
		- FaaS
		- SaaS
    - Mapping common GCP, AWS, Azure services to Cloud Nodes

6. Microservice pattern
7. Command Query Responsibility segregation (CQRS)

8. Design Pastebin.com or Bit.ly
9. Design Facebook news feed and search
10. Design a distributed web crawler
11. Design a system that scales to millions of users on AWS

12. System observability
	- Monitoring
	- Logging
	- Distributed Tracing


## For Fundamentals
* Try answering the following questions:
	- What is it?
	- Why do we need it?
	- How does it work?
	- How is it different from other services in that paradigm?
	- Example of how it works.
	- Examples of how it is useful.
* We are interested in more knowledge width and less depth
* Implementing anything is not compulsory, but you should provide clear instructions on how something could be implemented
	
## For system designs
* Explain the business summary, contraints and assumptions
* Setup a scenario of how much resources are expected to be consumed (cpu, bandwidth, memory, etc...)
* Start from a monolith and make it distributed gradually
* This is a gold mine: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

## General points
* There will be QA session after every presentation
* For resources, try googling first. Contact me only if you're having trouble finding resources.
